# NeuralNetworkAndDeepLearning

# Week 2 
1. Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network
2. Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
3. Implement computationally efficient, highly vectorized, versions of models.
4. Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
5. Become familiar with Python and Numpy
6. Work with iPython Notebooks
7. Be able to implement vectorization across multiple training examples


a. numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
b. h5py is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
c. matplotlib is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
d. PIL and scipy are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.
